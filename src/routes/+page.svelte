        </h2>
        <p>They see the link you posted on your social media account.</p>

        <p>To their pains.</p>
        <p>Their fears.</p>

          What it’s like to <span class="italic">want but not get</span> the thing your offer helps them

        </p>
        <p>Their eyes squint in disbelief as they see the content.</p>
        <p>“Is that real? Can they really help me get <span class="italic">that?"</span></p>
        <p>“I have to find out how…”</p>
        <p>They click the link and land on a page similar to this one.</p>
        <p class="italic underline">The headline makes their eyes go big with excitement.</p>
        <p>
          The text begins to describe a scene depicting their ideal future – or one far better than
          what they’d imagined before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your soon-to-be-customer imagines gaining a pleasant experience they’ve wanted for years
          but never had.
        </p>
        <p>They imagine becoming a better person they’ve wanted to be.</p>
        <p>They question how you can deliver the result, and then…</p>
        <p>We show them how.</p>
        <p>We show them proof.</p>
        <p>Your offer becomes the bridge across a gap they never thought they’d cross.</p>
        <p class="italic">
          Your offer becomes their path to the dream girl/guy, the dream job, the early retirement,
          the new house for them or their parents. The Ferrari and Rolex he knows he needs, the
          waist she’s wanted back since college. The raise or promotion, the routine suave story,

    </div>
    <div><h3 class="underline text-center">The process</h3></div>
    <div>
      <h4>Critical step #1</h4>
      <p>
        You are prepared to make cash by posting social media content every day or almost every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must be willing and able to drive traffic to your funnel, or nothing you do on the sales
        page will matter one bit.
      </p>
      <h4>Critical step #2</h4>

      <p>Be prepared to adhere to the previous step for many months or possibly years.</p>
      <p>A quality sales page stops working when you stop driving traffic to it.</p>
      <p>
        If your sales page is “good enough” you can keep the same zero-cost funnel running day and
        night for years.
      </p>
      <p class="underline">
        If you are both willing and able to commit to following those steps, read on.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        You might have a great offer that nonetheless <span class="italic">looks</span> doomed to failure
        because of the “saturated” nature of your market.
      </p>
      <p>That is completely fine.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, most extraordinary performers in your space once looked like generic,
        undifferentiated commodities.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the starting state of most offers that don’t have a genius marketer work on them.
      </p>
      <p>You will be fine or better than fine.</p>
      <p>Because you don’t have to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Drop 6 figures per year on a marketing agency to make and “maintain” your marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drop yet another 6 figures on a market research firm to “discover” what you likely already
          know about your buyers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grind through 8 weeks of evenings and weekends while holding down your 9-5 to handle your
          marketing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="underline">Here’s the ingredients of a successful offer:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li class="list-decimal">Your offer itself needs to be unique.</li>
        <p>
          You might think the way to succeed is to “be the best”... But when every offer out there
          is saying it, it’s really about how you’re different. What can they get from you but no
          one else?
        </p>
        <li class="list-decimal">You need to have proof that it works.</li>
        <p>
          Every potential buyer and their mom will have the same question: Will this work for me?
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll show them why those doubts and fears are unfounded in such a way that you yourself
          are certain all your customers can be helped.
        </p>
        <li class="list-decimal">What makes it scarce or exclusive?</li>
        <p>
          Free game: <span class="underline"
            >When you’re below 10,000 Twitter followers, and you’re the only one offering a specific
            piece of advice, your help is, by definition, both</span
          >.
        </p>
        <li class="list-decimal">How is it completely risk-free?</li>
        <p>
          People avoid the unsafe and are drawn towards guarantees. This isn’t skydiving or
          entrepreneurship, which attracts risk-takers. Most people are afraid to lose money and so
          we’ll show them how the real risk is missing out on buying.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <p class="underline">
        But even if you have absolutely no idea how to answer these questions at the moment...
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re in luck: Fortunately, you don’t need to have an answer to any of these questions
        right this second.
      </p>
      <p>We’ll talk and I’ll <span class="underline">give you answers</span> to all of them.</p>
      <p>
        Then I’ll write for two weeks (tops) and you will receive a full sales page absolutely
        filled with psychology and sales techniques.

      <p>By the end of the page, your soon-to-be-customers will be dying to have your product.</p>

          <p>
            Everyone makes decisions the same way: Unconsciously. And the unconscious, for whatever
            reason, isn’t great with big words or logic.

          <p>What it’s great with is sensory experience. It is an imagination machine.</p>
          <p>

            Your sales page will show them how investing in your offer means they have a great (not
            good, great) life on the horizon.
          </p>
          <p>
            That could mean having more material possessions, or, crucially, it could mean becoming
