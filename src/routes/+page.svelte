        <p>“Is that real? Can they really help me get <span class="italic">that?"</span></p>

          The text begins to describe a scene depicting their ideal future – or one far better than

        <p>
          Your soon-to-be-customer imagines gaining a pleasant experience they’ve wanted for years

        <p>They imagine becoming a better person they’ve wanted to be.</p>

        <p>We show them how.</p>
        <p>We show them proof.</p>
        <p>Your offer becomes the bridge across a gap they never thought they’d cross.</p>
        <p class="italic">
          Your offer becomes their path to the dream girl/guy, the dream job, the early retirement,
          the new house for them or their parents. The Ferrari and Rolex he knows he needs, the

          Your sales page will show them the completely believable yet hard to anticipate truth:

    <div class="p-group">
      <h4>Critical step #1</h4>
      <p>
        You are prepared to make cash by posting social media content every day or almost every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must be willing and able to drive traffic to your funnel, or nothing you do on the sales
        page will matter one bit.
      </p>
      <h4>Critical step #2</h4>

      <p>Be prepared to adhere to the previous step for many months or possibly years.</p>
      <p>A quality sales page stops working when you stop driving traffic to it.</p>
      <p>
        If your sales page is “good enough” you can keep the same zero-cost funnel running day and
        night for years.
      </p>
      <p class="underline">
        If you are both willing and able to commit to following those steps, read on.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-group">
      <p>
        You might have a great offer that nonetheless <span class="italic">looks</span> doomed to failure
        because of the “saturated” nature of your market.
      </p>
      <p>That is completely fine.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, most extraordinary performers in your space once looked like generic,
        undifferentiated commodities.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the starting state of most offers that don’t have a genius marketer work on them.
      </p>
      <p>You will be fine or better than fine.</p>
      <p>Because you don’t have to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Drop 6 figures per year on a marketing agency to make and “maintain” your marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drop yet another 6 figures on a market research firm to “discover” what you likely already
          know about your buyers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grind through 8 weeks of evenings and weekends while holding down your 9-5 to handle your
          marketing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="underline">Here’s the ingredients of a successful offer:</p>
      <ol type="1" class="mixed-group">
        <li class="list-decimal ml-12">Your offer itself needs to be unique.</li>
        <p>
          You might think the way to succeed is to “be the best”... But when every offer out there
          is saying it, it’s really about how you’re different. What can they get from you but no
          one else?
        </p>
        <li class="list-decimal ml-12">You need to have proof that it works.</li>
        <p>
          Every potential buyer and their mom will have the same question: Will this work for me?
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll show them why those doubts and fears are unfounded in such a way that you yourself
          are certain all your customers can be helped.
        </p>
        <li class="list-decimal ml-12">What makes it scarce or exclusive?</li>
        <p>
          Free game: <span class="underline"
            >When you’re below 10,000 Twitter followers, and you’re the only one offering a specific
            piece of advice, your help is, by definition, both</span
          >.
        </p>
        <li class="list-decimal ml-12">How is it completely risk-free?</li>
        <p>
          People avoid the unsafe and are drawn towards guarantees. This isn’t skydiving or
          entrepreneurship, which attracts risk-takers. Most people are afraid to lose money and so
          we’ll show them how the real risk is missing out on buying.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <p class="underline">
        But even if you have absolutely no idea how to answer these questions at the moment...
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re in luck: Fortunately, you don’t need to have an answer to any of these questions
        right this second.
      </p>
      <p>We’ll talk and I’ll <span class="underline">give you answers</span> to all of them.</p>
      <p>
        Then I’ll write for two weeks (tops) and you will receive a full sales page absolutely
        filled with psychology and sales techniques.

        <p>
          The customer will likely also learn that a common enemy is trying to take their victory
          away from them. This ups the stakes, builds trust, and makes them think the opportunity
          might slip away from them. (Watch for me to use this exact technique in about six pages.)

          You notice how this page is looooong... it’s because saying things over and over in

          <li class="list-disc">Dotcom Secrets (424 pages)</li>

        You could be a dopamine fiend and set out to read all of those yourself.
      </h3>
      <p>(I only read some of them.)</p>

      <p>But should you do this?</p>

      <p class="font-bold">NO.</p>

      <p>You aren’t trying to be a master copywriter.</p>

      <p>You don’t even want to do it as a hobby.</p>

      <p>(If you did, you wouldn’t have read this far.)</p>

      <p>
        You could also get a job as a sales rep (like I did), and spend 12 months selling via the
        phone or in person. This would help you go the extra mile to prepare for selling online.
      </p>

      <p>But should you do this?</p>

      <p class="font-bold">NO.</p>

      <p>
        You aren’t trying to master selling 1 on 1. Although The Wall St Playboys recommend
        learning, and it is a great idea, you don’t need to do that.
      </p>

      <p>Here’s what else you could do to prepare for writing a sales letter:</p>

      <p>
        Expert copywriter Joshua Lisec, and many others, use hypnotism to up the oomph in their
        sales letters.
      </p>

      <p>You could take an 8 week course in the subject (like I did).</p>

      <p>
        You could learn to weave in sensory details into your copy: What the buyer will feel, smell,
        taste, see and hear after they buy.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could learn to use your prospect’s current beliefs about the world and your offer. This
        would enable you to present your offer in the best light.
      </p>

      <p>
        You could learn to “pace” them, meaning match the beginning of the letter with their
        existing perceptions, to establish trust.
      </p>

      <p>But should you?</p>

      <p>No, you don’t need to do all that (and to be blunt, it’s complicated).</p>

      <p>You can skip the whole thing.</p>

      <p>Cicada is happy to help someone who can’t afford a $100,000 or even $10,000 sales page.</p>

      <p>
        Other copywriters want your offer to already be moving $5,000/month. (Because otherwise they
        aren’t sure they can sell it).
      </p>

      <p>
        Cicada is cool with your offer being green and untested, because the type of person who
        reads all that text is also game to follow the process. (And he’s sure he can sell it.)
      </p>

      <p class="font-bold">
        Cicada wants you to receive <span class="underline"

        That demands <span class="underline"
