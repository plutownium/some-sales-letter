    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Be prepared to adhere to the previous step for many months or possibly years.</p>
    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">A quality sales page stops working when you stop driving traffic to it.</p>
    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">If your sales page is “good enough” you can keep the same zero-cost funnel running day and

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">That is completely fine.</p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">In fact, most extraordinary performers in your space once looked like generic,

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Your sales page will use sensory language.</p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Everyone makes decisions the same way: Unconsciously. And the unconscious, for whatever
          reason, isn’t great with big words or logic.
        </p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">What it’s great with is sensory experience. It is an imagination machine.</p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Those feelings you’ve had while reading this page originated in the unconscious. You’re

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">That could mean having more material possessions, or, crucially, it could mean becoming a

          likely to be in their future. No deception involved. Because that’s not who either of us

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Your sales page will demonstrate how you and your current customers (or whichever word you
          use to describe them) share a lot in common with the person reading your sales page. In
          fact, struggles you and your current customers overcame in the past were exactly like the
          ones your potential customers experience now.
        </p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">The customer will likely also learn that a common enemy is trying to take their victory
          away from them. This ups the stakes, builds trust, and makes them think the opportunity
          might slip away from them. (Watch for me to use this exact technique in about six pages.)

          you to present the page to customers. You don’t need to act like or convey in any way that
          you’re the same as other people. You are an individual, unlike everyone else.

        <p class="italic svelte-1ho5xtf">On the topic of everyone else, we’ll (predictably) use...</p></div></div>

          new. Hence you’ll be invited to pick a dozen or so people at a time to receive your offer
          for free in exchange for providing several rounds of feedback on how it helped them.

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">People like helping people who helped them. We’ll remind readers, likely near the bottom,
          in subtle manner, that you’ve already provided helpful, actionable advice to them in some
          form. They will then be more likely to buy because they already like you.
        </p></div>
      <div class="bg-red px-4 sm:px-12 lg:px-40 pt-4 pb-8"><p class="svelte-1ho5xtf"><span class="underline">This will be easy on you</span>: You already do content marketing
          via Twitter, so you already help people often. The audience is a warm market! You helped
          them, so they trust your advice.
        </p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">And because they trust your advice, we’ll be able to use...</p></div></div>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">In short, since you can’t be there in person, your audience really needs to believe your
          offer will help them. If they don’t, your audience won’t buy, or even get to the page.
          Once they’re there though, we’ll use the trust they’ve built reading your tweets to
          convert into a sale.
        </p></div>
      <div class="bg-red px-4 sm:px-12 lg:px-40 pt-4 pb-8"><p class="svelte-1ho5xtf"><span class="underline">Yet you’ll never</span>: have to pretend to be a world class
          expert. In fact, being honest about your flaws and shortcomings will help you build trust
          (just don’t do it too much).

    <div class="persuasion-tool svelte-1ho5xtf"><div class="bg-green px-4 sm:px-12 lg:px-40 py-4 pb-8"><h3 class="mt-4 mb-2 text-2xl">Repetition.</h3>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You notice how this page is looooong... it’s because saying things over and over in
          different forms really helps with decision making. You give the audience not one, not two,
          but twelve or twenty opportunities to “get it” in different ways. Then, once they’ve
          understood and gone beyond nodding along...
        </p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">We’ll tell them to buy.</p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">We’ll say exactly what they need to do to get the offer they’ve imagined themselves having
          in 18 different ways.

      <div class="bg-red px-4 sm:px-12 lg:px-40 pt-4 pb-8"><p class="svelte-1ho5xtf"><span class="underline">Yet we won’t</span>: Bore them reading the same thing over and
          over. While we’ll stick to one big idea that is relevant to the reader, your sales page
          will avoid losing their attention by saying the same thing the same way twice.
        </p>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Finally they’ll understand that the offer is...</p></div></div>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">We’ll use a real reason that they have to get the offer right now or lose the opportunity
          forever. This may be that you can only handle a certain number of clients (true!) or that
          you’ll move on from your current offer after someday. (Also true!)

      <div class="bg-red px-4 sm:px-12 lg:px-40 pt-4 pb-8"><p class="svelte-1ho5xtf"><span class="underline">We&#39;ll be truthful and original with your offer&#39;s scarcity</span>:
          There will be absolutely no countdown timers or “limited quantities” (of digital products)

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">But should you do this?</p>

      <p class="font-bold svelte-1ho5xtf">NO.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You aren’t trying to be a master copywriter.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You don’t even want to do it as a hobby.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">(If you did, you wouldn’t have read this far.)</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You could also get a job as a sales rep (like I did), and spend 12 months selling via the

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You aren’t trying to master selling 1 on 1. Although The Wall St Playboys recommend
        learning, and it is a great idea, you don’t need to do that.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Here’s what else you could do to prepare for writing a sales letter:</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Expert copywriter Joshua Lisec, and many others, use hypnotism to up the oomph in their
        sales letters.

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You could take an 8 week course in the subject (like I did).</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You could learn to weave in sensory details into your copy: What the buyer will feel, smell,
        taste, see and hear after they buy.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You could learn to use your prospect’s current beliefs about the world and your offer. This
        would enable you to present your offer in the best light.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You could learn to “pace” them, meaning match the beginning of the letter with their
        existing perceptions, to establish trust.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">But should you?</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">No, you don’t need to do all that (and to be blunt, it’s complicated).</p>

      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Cicada is happy to help someone who can’t afford a $100,000 or even $10,000 sales page.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf"><span class="underline">Difference #2</span>: Other copywriters want your offer to already

      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Cicada is cool with your offer being green and untested, because the type of person who

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">If you currently have no sales material, or a page you wrote yourself (totally fine)…</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You’ll receive an aesthetic, psychology-laden sales page. It will convert and you’ll go from
        $0/month to $1,000 / week and beyond for as long as you’re sending it traffic.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">This offer won’t last forever.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You are reading about an offer that I guarantee will disappear within a few months’ time.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Blackhatwizard correctly states that doing work for free in the beginning is a good
        strategy.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">However:</p>

      <ol type="a"><li class="svelte-1ho5xtf">I only have room for so many clients.</li>
        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">If you are able to view this page, it means I have room for more. But I’ve already agreed
          to help five people. Odds are they’ll receive their sales pages, post them, realize the
          page rains cash, and I’ll move on to promoting a paid offer.
        </p>
        <li class="svelte-1ho5xtf">I’ll only be doing this for a few months at most.</li></ol>
      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You can tell I am great at writing and highly creative. Having practiced sales in one form
        or another for half a decade, you can be certain this offer will cost money in the near
        future.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">In the meantime, you can get a sales letter written for your product for free.</p>
      <h2 class="mt-4 svelte-1ho5xtf">“But what do you get out of doing it for free?”</h2>
      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">90% of people who receive this free help will do something to pay me back. Indeed helping
        people out without asking anything in return is a great reward.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">If you sense you will be among the 90%, you are welcome to proceed. If you are among the 10%
        who has no intention of paying me back, you are also welcome to proceed!
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">However, both types of people should be aware…</p></div></div></div></div>

      </h2>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You are either pre-sales or early on in your WiFi money sales career.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You have my empathy as I understand what it’s like to spend weeks crafting a PDF, sell it
        using a Twitter account, and hope that it frees you from relying on the 9-5.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">To hope you’re finally able to take the WSPB’s advice of “de-risking” by having multiple
        income streams.
      </p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">It’s hard to do.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Inventing an idea that will sell is hard.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Committing to pursuing an idea is hard.</p>

      <p class="italic svelte-1ho5xtf">Seeing it flop is hardest of all.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">So while I will bust my ass writing to help you, you are asked to repay the favor by:</p>

      <ol type="1" class="mixed-group svelte-1ho5xtf"><li class="ml-12 list-decimal svelte-1ho5xtf">Writing a testimonial describing how the sales letter changed your WiFi money business.
        </li>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">You can help me out big time by describing:</p>

        <ul class="ml-12 svelte-1ho5xtf"><li class="list-disc svelte-1ho5xtf">Where you were before you found me</li>
          <li class="list-disc svelte-1ho5xtf">What stopped you from selling without me</li>
          <li class="list-disc svelte-1ho5xtf">What it was like to have someone handle selling for you</li></ul>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">And then…</p>

        <ul class="ml-12 svelte-1ho5xtf"><li class="list-disc svelte-1ho5xtf">How far you made it in 1-2 months using the sales page</li>
          <li class="list-disc svelte-1ho5xtf">What it was like to have the sales</li></ul>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">The other thing you can provide is:</p>

        <li class="ml-12 list-decimal svelte-1ho5xtf">Sales data from previous traffic (e.g. through Gumroad). Please provide copious
          before/after screenshots, identifying info removed.
        </li>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">My goal is to prove what I already know:</p>

        <p class="italic svelte-1ho5xtf">That my sales letters sell and sell well.</p>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">That is the second half of the transaction.</p>

        <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">So yes, it does cost some time and energy to participate.</p></ol></div></div></div></div>





<div class="w-full flex justify-center"><div class="w-11/12 sm:w-10/12 md:w-8/12"><div class="mt-4 px-4 sm:px-12 lg:px-40 pt-6 pb-10 p-group bg-blue svelte-1ho5xtf"><h2 class="mt-4 underline font-bold text-center pr-8 svelte-1ho5xtf">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “What if I don’t have a product or service ready to sell?”</h3>

    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">A: You are welcome to message me for free brainstorming about what you could sell, what you
      could offer. So long as you commit to posting the page until it gets to 10,000 views, you are
      welcome to tell me “I only have an idea.” We can do a pre-sale, or in other words, “Sell it
      before you build it.”
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “Why is it free?”</h3>

    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">A: Some people like to sell their service before they’ve lifted a finger to confirm they can
      perform. I am the opposite. Your results will go with me as case studies to my first paid
      clients.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “This won’t work for me.”</h3>

    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">A: Without knowing exactly why you say that, you can be sure that as long as you put the sales
      page in front of 10,000 people, you will make 100 sales. That is a 1% conversion rate and is
      achievable.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl">Q: “What if I can’t or won’t put in 10-20 hours to help research the market?”
    </h3>

    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">If you want to speedrun your part of the bargain, you can complete the entire onboarding
      process in three hours. All you have to do is indicate to in clear language that:
    </p>

    <ol type="a" class="ml-12"><li class="list-decimal svelte-1ho5xtf">You understand that your sales would perform better with research.
      </li>
      <li class="list-decimal svelte-1ho5xtf">You commit to posting the page until it gets 10,000 views.</li></ol>

    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">If you confirm that you’d prefer “Low inputs + decent payoff” to “high inputs + great payoff,”
      I’m happy to bang out a sales page in 48 hours with little research.
    </p>
    <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">However, I recommend you don’t make a habit of it. <span class="font-bold">The version made with 20 hours of research put into it will sell better and net you
        hundreds of more sales across a twelve month timeframe.</span></p></div></div></div>

      <h2 class="mt-4 svelte-1ho5xtf">If you’re already making sales online, you know that the notification of a transaction is a
        rush like no other.
      </h2>
      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Either way, you know you want to sell so often that the rush goes away, and you’re just…

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Wealthy.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">At which point a sale is a notification like any other.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">But so far, the notifications don’t bore you yet.</p>

      <p class="svelte-1ho5xtf">Because you are at the point where a 5 figure price tag on a sales funnel that might not
        work is too risky.
